This is just a line of text with a slash mark at the end/

Here is more text, however, there is no slash.


This is before a comment, so it will output 

"This is a quoted comment /* asndklasdl */ " so it will print to output
/ * If there is a space inbetween the slash and the asterik, we will still print
