This is just a line of text with a slash mark at the end/

Here is more text, however, there is no slash.


This is before a comment, so it will output /*  This is in a comment, so it will not output */

"This is a quoted comment /* asndklasdl */ " so it will print to output
/ * If there is a space inbetween the slash and the asterik, we will still print

/* Here, we have a commented out "string literal" */

/* /* Another important test is the nested comment */ */

/* Unending comment



End (this will not print because we have an unending comment)
